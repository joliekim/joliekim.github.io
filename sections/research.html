                        This study provides insights into how a tabletop robot companion influences the productivity of 
                        knowledge workers in WFH settings. By evaluating Roby in real-world contexts, we identify key factors 
                        that we hope can inform the design of future intelligent robot companions to optimize remote work 
                        experiences across various professional domains.
